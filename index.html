              <p>James and I will package the project at least once a week or after a major update but every now and then the build will have a BSOD (black screen of death). <br><br>We often look at the logs in the Saved directory and search for any errors however, there can be very little information relating to the actual problem and in situations like these we may have to revert to previous commits to isolate the last working packaged build. <br><br>One of the things we learnt was to be careful when using Blueprint to manipulate certain C++ data, in an episode of BSOD we found that using a Blueprint function to clear a PlayerArray declared in the header file of the GameInstance was the source of the issue. Since our Blueprints handled creating and destroying multiplayer sessions, it made sense to clear the array there. To get around this I exposed a Blueprint callable function which clears the array.</p>

              <p>Each map has 6 spawn points where the Runners will start, the package will spawn on one of the three opposite spawn points to the starting location. Seekers spawn in the middle of the map. <br><br>James, Kartik and I worked together to restructure the existing code and deliver this feature in a more efficient manner. We used OnPostLogin in the base GameMode to save player data into the PlayerArray on the GameInstance. This is done to maintain that data on map change since the GameMode will get cleared when moving from the Lobby map to any gameplay map. <br><br>The spawning logic was originally done in OnPostLogin, however, this only executes once when entering the Lobby so we moved it to HandleStartingNewPlayer which will run whenever a new player joins. This allows players to join halfway through a game.</p>

              <p>Kartik and I planned out and created an ability system which had to accommodate for different skeletal meshes and animations. The direction from design was that the arms can't be used at the same time and that we there should be an active state for which arm is in use. To handle this we used functions for binding and unbinding input actions as well as changing the respective mapping context.</p>

              <p>Whilst working closely with Chisom to deliver her UI design, we would break down the image requirements together and discuss how it would affect the programming.<br><br>The radial active arm widget has a lower opacity outside of the 'active' segment so we figured the best way to implement this was to overlay two images at 50% opacity and the overlap of the active segment would be at 100% opacity.<br><br>The health widget is a typical progress bar with two images: the fill and the frame. A function in the Characters tick will update the health whenever it changes.<br><br>Minimap is a WIP.</p>

              <p>I worked on a flexible movement component which gives designers additional options for switch activation and looping. As long as a switch is placed in the level, it can be selected in the details panel but by default the movement and rotation of the object will activate if no switch is selected. Since switches can have this movement component they can essentially act as a door as activating the switch again returns the object to its original transformation.</p>

              <p>We decided on implementing gameplay tags to give objects or actors properties which would be easier for designers to use in the details panel. These properties determine what interactions or arms can manipulate the object. I discussed with Kartik whether we could use just a tag for magnetic objects but having the property as a component made more sense to handle the range of movements needed during magnetism.</p>

              <p>The grapple arm uses line traces and gameplay tags to determine whether the player gets pulled or they pull an object towards themselves. The transformations are calculated through a Lerp (linear interpolation) with a curve exposed for designers to fine tune how a grapple launch may decelerate.</p>
